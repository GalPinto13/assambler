Macro:
    no error detection
    we assume the macro's name is not a saved word.

First pass:
    Text:
        max chars in a line: 80 + (optional)new line char + terminator char(predefined in macro - global.h)
        max words in a line: 50 (predefined in macro - global.h)
        no comma in end of line
    Labels:
        max chars: 30 (predefined in macro - global.h)
        no saved words allowed
        only alphanumeric chars are allowed
        starts with a char(not a digit)
        ends with a colon(:)
        a label must be defined only once
    Numbers:
        if used @ instruction line - range: -128 <= x <= 127
        if used @ guidance line - range: -512 <= x <= 511
        can be signed/unsigned
        only integers
    String:
        only ASCII chars
        quotation on both sides
    Instructions:
        allowed operations
        a specific number of allowed operands for each instruction
        allowed methods for source/dest
    Guidance:
        data:
            every 2 numbers must have a comma between
        struct:
            first is a number, second is a string

Second pass:
    Labels:
        the used label wasn't found in the file
    Entry:
        entry label must exist in the source file
        entry label can't be defined also as an external label
    Extern:
        the extern label was already defined in the source file
